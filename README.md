#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is applying engineering principles, methods and tools to develop and maintain high quality softwaresystems.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Milestones include the development of programming languages (e.g., Fortran, C), 
the establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s, 
the advent of structured programming in the 1970s, 
and the rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
- Design: Creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
- Implementation: Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
- Testing: Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
- Deployment: Releasing the software to users or customers.
- Maintenance: Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after
deployment.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
 Waterfall: Sequential approach with distinct phases (e.g., requirements, design, implementation) flowing downwards like a waterfall.
 scenarios:
 Well-defined Projects: Waterfall is ideal for projects with clear, unchanging requirements. For example, government projects or regulated industries like aerospace and healthcare often use Waterfall due to the need for thorough documentation and regulatory compliance.
Short-term Projects: Small projects with a short duration and well-understood technology stack are also suitable for the Waterfall model.

- Agile: Iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration, and responding to change.
- scenarios
- Dynamic Projects: Agile is suitable for projects where requirements are expected to evolve, such as in startups or tech companies developing new products.
Large, Complex Projects: When a project is complex and likely to encounter changes or where user feedback is critical, Agile allows for iterative development that can respond to those changes.
Customer-Centric Projects: Projects that require frequent input from users or stakeholders to shape the final product are ideal for Agile.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
- Software Developer: Responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
- Quality Assurance Engineer: Ensures software quality by designing and executing test
- Project Manager: Oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects. 


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
 Integrated Development Environments (IDEs): Software suites that provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing code (e.g., Visual Studio, Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA).
- Version Control Systems (VCS): Software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members (e.g., Git, Subversion).


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
 Changing Requirements: Requirements may change during the development cycle, leading to scope creep and project delays.
- Tight Deadlines: Pressure to deliver software products on schedule can result in rushed development and compromised quality.
- Technical Debt: Accrued from shortcuts or suboptimal solutions, technical debt can impede future development efforts and increase maintenance costs.
Strategies for Overcoming Challenges: Strategies for overcoming challenges include effective communication, agile methodologies, prioritization of tasks, and regular reassessment of project goals and timelines.
 

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
- Importance of Testing: Testing is a critical aspect of QA and involves various types of testing, including:
- Unit Testing: Testing individual components or modules of software.
- Integration Testing: Testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
- System Testing: Testing the entire software system as a whole.
- Acceptance Testing: Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.



#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the crafting of questions and instructions in a way that helps get the best response from the AI assistant. ie how you want it presented.
The importance of prompt engineering in interacting with AI models, include
Improved quality of output
Task specific optimization
Ethical consideration


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague - What is software engineering
Improved, As a software ebgineering studeent, define software engineering to a 7 year old african child using emojis and make it fun and easy to understand.
